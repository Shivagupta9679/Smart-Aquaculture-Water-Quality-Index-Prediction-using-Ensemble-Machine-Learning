# Smart-Aquaculture-Water-Quality-Index-Prediction-using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning
## Project Overview

Water quality is one of the most critical factors affecting aquaculture productivity and fish health. Poor water quality can lead to disease outbreaks, reduced growth, and significant economic losses.

This project develops an end-to-end Machine Learning solution to predict the **Water Quality Index (WQI)** of aquaculture systems using physicochemical water parameters. Multiple regression algorithms are compared, the best-performing model is optimized using hyperparameter tuning, and Explainable AI (SHAP) is used to interpret model predictions.

A Streamlit web application is also developed for real-time prediction and batch prediction.

 # Objectives
